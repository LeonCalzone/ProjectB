In appearance it consists of a soft, wide stretch of muscular tissue curled deliberately around its main structure, which is itself lined with some kind of papillae. These odd filaments, reminiscent of sea anemones, are of a purple-blue color. Study of this organ proved difficult, as any attempt to uncouple it from that which it protects caused the flesh to involuntarily seize. The filaments, previously soft when at rest, now tensed in a frantic measure to shield its inner contents. Despite the early stages of decay clearly apparent, this organ is still active. Still warm.

Though dim, they flash in a steady pattern visible to observers through the translucent outer layer of the structure. Geometric and calculated, these tiny lights dance together within the pocketed organ in the depths of the creature. This process occurs only in total darkness. When exposed to light, these pulsing flashes cease to play.">

The first that was found is an irregularly shaped pearlescent orb made up of many smaller circular parts that have been somehow fused together. The second has an intricate crystalline pattern, of a similar shape to the first, and is bluish in color. Both are understood to consist of biological material.

Its many armlike structures reach out far beyond the understood central body of the organ and into other areas of the abdomen. These tendrils vary in their length and thickness, some like wide branches and others with a fine threadlike quality. It folds and twists around on both itself and nearby structures in such a way that makes it impossible to remove from the cadaver. Unfortunately, closer study of the organ is impossible. It is remarkably fragile, as any touch causes pieces of this intricate system to detach from its main branch. So far, there is no explanation for this phenomenon to occur.">

The incisors are of humanoid appearance, but due to the dehydrated nature of dead flesh, the gum line indicates that there may be additional teeth hidden above these exposed incisors that are markedly longer in size and sharper in shape. Next to the incisors in both the top and bottom jaw reside two large fang-like cuspids, for a total amount of four. The remaining teeth, of which there are twelve in number, are wide tri-pointed molars of incredible sharpness. The next thing of particular note was the creature’s strange tongue. The length of this apparatus, unable to fit flatly in the oral cavity, folds onto itself to be stored neatly in the back of the mouth. In texture, it is found to be of semi-firm tissue with small ridges on both sides. Interestingly, the tongue appears to consist of spongy erectile tissue. It is unknown why the creature possesses such an organ, vaguely similar to the proboscis of certain insects, when considering the nature of the teeth. Further dissection needed.">
